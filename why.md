# Why?

First of all, I am in desperate need of fellow electronics and microelectronics developers of all kinds - analog cirquit artists, PCB routing engeneers, architects for software and verification, rtl designers, verification engineers - all those kinds of developers.

And it isn't fair to show them how to implement their ideas using some commercial software. All those software are superb, believe me, but you can express your ideas in the code, and, it is much more important - you can model, simulate those ideas and share them without commerial simulators. And you can switch to those software products when you will have them available, it is not a big deal: all those software products are instuments and made to allow you to do your job in less time. But many of us just need a place to start.
